# Mini projects in Operation search(OR). 
Most of Codes is made by R, Python

**1.DEA**

To anaylze effiency of retail stores of fashion sales company 'P' with virtual datas, I used R packages. It's just for practicing how to use DEA method with programming tech.   
I used CCR, BCC model as not only input-oriented also output-oriented.
Before using DEA methods, I did Pearson correlation coefficient tests due to eliminate unsuited variables.
The variables contained in code has no correlation problems.

**2.AHP**

It's not completed, so I keep make it on. What I intended is show parameters to evualte satisfaction of customers and use it for QFD(Quality function deployment).
The problem I met : 
1. Not able to collect reviews from 'several' pages.
2. Collected reviews are duplicated in each product group.
When I fix it, I will upload codes.
